      <h3>Muted Destiny</h3>
      <p>
        .......As I sat on my bed, looking up at the ceiling like I was in an
        examination hall clueless about what to write, actually here, in
        reality, I was clueless of what next, though my flesh was satisfied as
        always, my inner man was yearning for survival. <br />
        "Thank you, sir, I enjoyed myself to the full. You are the best”. My
        weakness said to me as she left my room to her room next door.
        <br />Kunle, you don’t need all these things you are doing, remember who
        you are, this life you are living won’t take you anywhere". <br />Those
        are words of Wande, my longtime friend, who isn’t fed up with advising
        me, he told me one day when she caught my weakness in bed with me. Since
        that day, those words keep ringing in my heart, and that moment wasn't
        an exemption. Okay, Wait! Let me introduce myself. <br />
        My name is Kunle Donald, the first child and only son of Pastor and late
        Lady Evangelist Oluwafunto Donald of Jehova Nissi Gospel Church. <br />
        I am a young naïve 18 years old boy, at least to my dad, I am still
        innocent, but the actual reality is different. <br />
        I am a first-class student; this has allowed me to have my way with
        almost all my female classmates. Yes, classmates, Ladies flock around
        me, like birds. <br />Though I don’t like all the attention that came
        with my brilliancy, that’s my weakness. Let’s take a pause here. Already
        tired, I prayed to God for forgiveness, I know God must be tired of
        hearing me asking for forgiveness always. <br />But I persist in turning
        back to God. After the prayer, I slept off, I saw a young man in my
        dream, he always come to have a word with me. <br /><i
          ><strong>“My young friend,”</strong></i
        >
        as he always call me, “why don’t you face your weakness, you are born
        for greatness, and your destiny needs nurturing, but this weakness might
        hinder you from reaching your peak and might cause your destiny to be
        muted, your light might turn to darkness soon if you aren’t careful”.
        <br />He said in finality as he looked me in the face. <br />“I have
        heard you sir, but you need to help me” I replied him with an expectant
        heart. "I will surely visit you later my young friend, I will answer
        your question from there." He said in finality. <br />The ringing tone
        coming from my phone draws me away from my dream. I sluggishly picked
        the phone and took it to my ear with one of my eyes still closed, I wish
        we could talk more. <br />His words are always comforting.
        <q
          >Bro Kunle, where are you, have you forgotten you are taking the
          opening prayer?</q
        >
        Immediately, I stood up from the bed, still confused, “eh hmmm, Bro
        Theophilus, I don’t know what you are talking about” I replied to him,
        still confused. <br />
        “You are taking the opening prayer at the General fellowship End of
        Semester program, Bro Kunle, hurry up, you have ten minutes to get here”
        Bro Theophilus replied and the line went off........
